# Speech-Interface-System
This portfolio project is a **TTS** and **STT** systems Which a fantastic idea. Below is a step-by-step guide to design and implement.
### **Project Title: Speech Interface System**
**Objective:**  
Build a system that integrates speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities to create a conversational or task-driven application.
---

### **Project Overview**
The system will:  
1. Convert spoken input into text (STT).  
2. Perform a task based on the recognized text (e.g., answering questions, controlling devices, or providing information).  
3. Generate natural-sounding speech output in response to user queries (TTS).  
---

### **Technologies and Tools**
1. **Programming Language:** Python  
2. **STT Frameworks/Tools:**  
   - Hugging Face Wav2Vec 2.0  
   - Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API  
3. **TTS Frameworks/Tools:**  
   - NVIDIA Tacotron 2 and WaveGlow  
   - Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API  
4. **Libraries:**  
   - PyTorch  
   - TensorFlow  
   - Hugging Face Transformers  
   - Librosa for audio processing  
5. **Deployment Platforms:**  
   - Flask or FastAPI for the backend  
   - Streamlit for a simple UI  
   - Docker for containerization  
---

### **Project Features**
1. **Speech-to-Text Integration:**  
   Accept user audio input and transcribe it into text.  

2. **Task Processing:**  
   Add functionality to process text input. Examples:  
   - Answer FAQs using a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., GPT or BERT).  
   - Trigger simple actions (e.g., "Turn on the light").  

3. **Text-to-Speech Integration:**  
   Generate natural-sounding audio responses to the processed text.  

4. **User Interface:**  
   A simple web-based UI where users can record their speech, see the text transcription, and listen to the system's response.

### **Implementation Steps**
#### 1. **Environment Setup**
- Install required libraries:  
```bash
pip install torch transformers librosa flask streamlit google-cloud-speech google-cloud-texttospeech
```

- Set up Google Cloud credentials if using their APIs.
